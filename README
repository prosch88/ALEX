# ALEX
**Android Logical Extractor**

This is a Python script intended as an ADB counterpart to [UFADE](https://github.com/prosch88/UFADE).

It utilizes [adbutils](https://github.com/openatx/adbutils) to automate the acquisition of mobile devices (Mostly Android) via ADB.
Many of the features are based on the Bash Script [android_triage](https://github.com/RealityNet/android_triage), and one of the basic ideas behind the project is to make these features available across all common operating systems.
Since I only have a limited supply of test devices and the features offered vary across different manufacturers, I am dependent on the support of the community to ensure stable and predictable behavior.

The interface is based on [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter). This project is at an early stage and compiled versions will follow, when more testing is done.

Requires Python == 3.11.

More features may follow.

## Usage

Activate ADB debugging on the device and connect an Ap device to your workstation, unlock and pair the device.
Start the script:
```
python alex.py
```

Possibly the trust-message is shown on the device screen. Confirm with "always trust this computer".
Now you should see the device information screen and will be prompted to choose a working directory.
By default, the script is setting this to the directory from which it has been called.

Currently extractions are possible for Android, WearOS and Ubuntu Touch devices.
